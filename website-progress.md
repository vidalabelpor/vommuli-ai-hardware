## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS & TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Standard Deployment Process**
1. **Code Changes**: Make updates to repository files
2. **Git Commit**: `git add .` ‚Üí `git commit -m "Description"`
3. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin main`
4. **Automatic Deployment**: Vercel should auto-deploy via webhook

### **If Deployment Fails (Lessons Learned)**
**Common Issue**: GitHub ‚Üí Vercel webhook integration failure

**Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Check if commits are reaching GitHub
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/vidalabelpor/vommuli-ai-hardware/commits?per_page=3"

# Check current deployment ETag
curl -s -I https://vommuli.com | grep etag
```

**Emergency Deployment Methods** (in order of preference):
1. **Manual Vercel CLI Deployment**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod --yes
   ```

2. **Force Webhook Trigger**:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "FORCE WEBHOOK: Empty commit to trigger deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Combination Approach** (what worked for visual enhancement):
   - Manual CLI deployment first to create fresh build
   - Empty commit to restore webhook functionality
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for propagation

### **Tailwind CSS v4 Deployment Issues**
**Problem**: Enhanced classes not generating in production
**Solutions Applied**:
- Added `safelist` array to `tailwind.config.js`
- Created `tailwind-classes.txt` reference file
- Implemented inline style fallbacks for critical visual elements

**Files Modified for Visual Enhancement**:
- `/tailwind.config.js` - Safelist configuration
- `/tailwind-classes.txt` - Class reference for build detection
- `/app/page.tsx` - Inline style fallbacks
- `/app/globals.css` - Direct CSS rules backup

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Check if visual enhancements are live
curl -s https://vommuli.com | grep -o 'linear-gradient'

# Verify new deployment
curl -s -I https://vommuli.com | grep etag

# Check CSS compilation
curl -s https://vommuli.com | grep -o "/_next/static/css/[a-z0-9]*\.css"
```
